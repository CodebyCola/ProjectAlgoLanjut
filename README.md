I created this program with my friend when we were still in the 2nd semester of college.
This program takes the admin as its main user, so students who borrow books do not input their own data but are inputted by the library admin.

We made this with basic C++ language where we apply struct,recursive function, arrays, sorting and searching algorithms as well as pointers and files.
